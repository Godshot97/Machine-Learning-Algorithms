<h1>Default of credit card clients dataset</h1> 
<h2>The dataset came from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients<br>Model predict if given payment in the next month will be timely or default. Prediction result depends on different variables such as clients age or marital status and also his credit history from the previous 6 months.</h2>
<p><b>Business goal: </b>provide information on the customer's creditworthiness to lenders.</p>
<p>The data set was cleaned, so I hardly made any transformations. I trained 6 different classification models. For further tuning I took 2: Decison Tree and Support Vector Machines.</p>
