<h1>Default of credit card clients dataset</h1> 
<h2>The dataset came from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients<br>Model predict if given payment in the next month will be timely or default. Prediction result depends on different variables related with clients credit history from the previous 6 months as well as on client personal data such as age or marital status.</h2>
<p><b>Business goal: </b>provide information on the customer's creditworthiness to lenders.</p>
<p>The data set was cleaned, so I hardly made any transformations. I trained 6 different classification models. For further tuning I took 2: Decison Tree and Support Vector Machines. I used grid search method.</p>
