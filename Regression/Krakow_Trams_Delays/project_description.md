<h1>Krakow Trams Delays dataset</h1>
<h2>The dataset came from:<br> https://github.com/aczepielik/KRKtram/tree/master/reports.<br>
Dataset description (Polish language):<br> https://aczepielik.github.io/post/kraktram/</h2> 

<b>Business goal:</b> provide information to passengers, about estimated delays on tram lines in Krakow.

The amount of tram delay can be a component of various factors. <br><b>Considered factors:</b>
- a specific stop (delay at stop in the city center can be greater than those on the suburbs)
- line number (various routes and their lengths)
- the direction in which the tram is heading (driving in a one direction may generate longer delays than the opposite)
- time of day (during rush hours you can expect more delays)
- vehicle ID (older trams may have grater delays than new ones, because they accelerate slower)
- route stop number (at the initial stops the delay may be lower, delay can accumulate with time)
